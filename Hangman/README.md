# Hangman

<br/>In this game, you are asked to guess all the letters in a word from sowpods.txt. 
<br/>If the word is, let's say, "SUPERMAN."
<br/>You enter the letter "s". Then it would display "S-------".
<br/>Then you enter "a". It would display "S-----A-".
<br/>If the letter you entered is not in the word, you would have six chances to guess again.
<br/>This cycle would keep going on until you fill up all the blanks.
<br/>Then, if lucky enough, you fill up the entire word correctly, you can choose to play again.
