# Python 101

## A shortcut through the woods 

I follow the footprints of many masters as I travelled through the forest of learning Python.
And as I have heard, it's better to leave some bread crumbs since I am definitely not the last one self-learning Python and figuring what is the best way of coding.

## My first lessons of Python

Many thanks to [@karan](https://github.com/karan/Projects) who provided a big list of projects.
The giant list is the backbone of this repository, Python 101.
This repository contains a bunch of mini-programs that helped myself better familiarize Python.
I hope it could also help you.
But newcomers make mistakes and write in distort ways.
I am more than grateful if you leave a comment or pull requests to share some new projects or some thoughts.
You can also fork this repo and add your own projects as well.

# List of programs

### First Programs

The programs in this file is the most basic concepts one should proceed in python, including Hello World, Input, List Comprehension, and so on. This file would be constantly updated because it is not comprehensive now. If you want to bring in some programs, feel free to pull requests.

**Hello World**
<br/> **Input** - Input information and use the format of printing.
<br/> **List Comprehension** - It is very powerful and straightforward!
<br/> **List of Set** - Introducing the difference of list and set and how to combine them.
<br/> **NumPy** - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing. I aim to create a folder for NumPy in the future!
<br/> **Reverse a Sentence** - Though not practical, it's good to practice definition and creativity!

### Numbers

**Even Odd** - Find out whether the input number is even or odd.
<br/>**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
<br/>**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
<br/>**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
<br/>**Prime Number** - Write a program to test if the input number is a prime or not.
<br/>**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
<br/>**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one. 
<br/>**Change Return Program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.
<br/>**Happy Number** - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display all the Happy Numbers in from 1 to 1000.

### Little Game

I created several games to entertain myself (geek). Please leave a comment if you want to introduce the game you created!

**Cow Bull** - Randomly generate a 4-digit number. Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” The player wins until they get four cows, since the correct numbers are in the correct places.
<br/> **Guess number by user** - Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, tell themu whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
<br/> **Guess number by computer** - The program will guess a number, and you will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number. At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
<br/> **Hangman** - In this game, you are asked to guess all the letters in a word from sowpods.txt. If the word is, let's say, "SUPERMAN." You enter the letter "s". Then it would display "S-------". If the letter you entered is not in the word, you would have six chances to guess again.
<br/> **Password generator** - The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password
<br/> **Rock paper scissors**
<br/> **Tic Tac Toe**
