# Tic Tac Toe

<br/>The game starts out with an empty game board like this

<br/>game = [[0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0]]

<br/>Ask the user to enter coordinates in the form “row,col”, a number, then a comma, then a number.

<br/>I want to move starting from (1, 1) instead of (0, 0).

<br/>To people who don’t program, starting to count at 0 is a strange concept
